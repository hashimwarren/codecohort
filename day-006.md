# What did you code today?

Started a very basic shell for a php fitness website. Going to spend the next week or so expanding on it and turning it into something I may be able to call a template.

"Finished up" yesterday's code. Took all day and some direct help! Yeesh. It works as it should (but I don't fully understand why yet), so NOW I can move on.
