# What did you code today?

- Did a quick review of descriptive stats, started in on inferential stats.  
- Researched more job descriptions and school possibilities. I'd like a more direct (and thorough!) route than my current, meandering one.  
- Found someone interested in collaborating on a data project though! We have to find a good project now. :)
