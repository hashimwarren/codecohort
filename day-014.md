# What did you code today?

## Shauna ##

This past week has been all over the place. A few days was the last push to get everything done and submitted (by the 9th) to qualify for the PyTorch Scholarship. Boy was that hectic, but I made it. Should hear back by the end of the week...

Then I kind of took a couple days off - during which I actually fiddled with my project submission to try to improve it (but it didn't improve at all).

Then I DID take a couple days off, during which I started trying to organize myself. (Should I return to school? Continuing ed? Just do some projects and more classes on my own? I've contacted a couple of programs to talk with them. Haven't heard back yet.)

And today, I'm finally back to actually coding/learning. 
- Started 1mwtt's Winter of Data (not sure yet if I'll commit to the whole thing). 
- Finished up DataCamp's part 1 of Statistical Thinking. Really tough since the theory was mostly new to me. I think I might supplement before continuing with part 2.
