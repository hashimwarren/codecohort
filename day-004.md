# What did you code today?

I realized that I've been watching a lot of tutorials but haven't actually coded a website in a while. So I practiced tonight and have to admit, it didn't come as fast to me as it should have.

My first post here, although I have been coding the past couple days.

Today, I got some decent progress on the [Image Classifier project](https://github.com/udacity/pytorch_challenge) for the [PyTorch challenge](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship) (which is basically [this free course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) plus the project).
