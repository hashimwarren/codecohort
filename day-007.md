# What did you code today?

## Emily 

Spent the better part of the day learning how to use Git and GitHub. Using this update as practice. 

Also learned a good bit about **Markdown** and I'm excited to able to make my updates look :sparkles: pretty :sparkles:

Planning to spend the evening reading/working through [You Don't Know JS: Up & Going](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V20DQU8/ref=series_dp_rw_ca_3)
