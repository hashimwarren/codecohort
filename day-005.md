# What did you code today?

## Nicole

Added my php contact form to my project folder.

## Hashim

Learned Javascript string methods. Was expecting to be bored, but I was surprised by some of the power.

## Shauna ##

Spent most of the day whittling through the challenge project. It shouldn't be taking me this long, but I _am_ putting the pieces together.  
Holy cow, do I need to practice Numpy and image manipulation.
