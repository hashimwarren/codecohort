# What did you code today?

## Hashim

Practiced Javascript Math and the Number Object. Learned a useful pattern for generating random numbers

Also learned more about block scope vs function scope, let vs var.

Lastly, learned about reassigning types

Didn't quite complete an hour, because I snuck time during lunch. Hope to review flashcards to fill my time
