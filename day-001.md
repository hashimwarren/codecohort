# What did you code today?

Nicole - Installed WordPress on my localhost and chose a theme. Haven't started the php site yet for this challenge but still did some development.

Today I was working on my second blog post for [unimprecssed.com](https://unimprecssed.com) and fell down the rabbit hole of
converting the blog to using MDX instead of markdown so I could add in more
interactive content. Mission accomplished. I'm thinking of writing a post about
it, and submitting it to Gatsby for some sweet OSS (open source swag) ðŸ˜‰ 

I also worked on my [#theShippening](https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23theshippening) project, 
which has an annoying bug I'm trying to wrap my head around. I'll share the link when I get the bug worked out, 
but it's a small pomodoro web-app with offline support that utlizes localStorage.
