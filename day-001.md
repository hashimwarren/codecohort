# What did you code today?


## Nicole
Installed WordPress on my localhost and chose a theme. Haven't started the php site yet for this challenge but still did some development.

I guess I can add that I learned more about **markdown** too. :grinning: :sparkling_heart:


## Matt
Today I was working on my second blog post for [unimprecssed.com](https://unimprecssed.com) and fell down the rabbit hole of
converting the blog to using MDX instead of markdown so I could add in more
interactive content. Mission accomplished. I'm thinking of writing a post about
it, and submitting it to Gatsby for some sweet OSS (open source swag) ðŸ˜‰ 

I also worked on my [#theShippening](https://twitter.com/search?vertical=default&q=%23theshippening) project, 
which has an annoying bug I'm trying to wrap my head around. I'll share the link when I get the bug worked out, 
but it's a small pomodoro web-app with offline support that utlizes localStorage.

## Hashim
Started ["Modern Javascript from the Beginning"](https://www.udemy.com/share/10015YAEMbdlpR/) course. Hope to relearn basics and take it further. I feel irrationaly embarrassed that I worked on something so "simple"

Practiced the [difference between var, let, const](https://github.com/hashimwarren/hashim-xyz/tree/master/Modern-JavaScript-from-the-Beginning)

Had to sneak time in before washing the dishes and after putting the kids to bed.
